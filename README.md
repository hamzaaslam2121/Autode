## Status 
Currently in an intermediate stage of development, with a significant amount of work already completed. While it remains a work in progress, it its value is potential and not realized. I am for WWTA to eventually deliver a flawless, enriching, and above all useful experience. Despite its incompleteness, the groundwork laid so far has set the stage for a compelling and valuable final product in the future. The main feature left to be implemented is the use of markers and posts, as currently the map is functioning without the ability to make posts, which is a fundamental part of this project. I will however not stop there, and continue to augment WWTA in the near future. I will be working on this in my freetime.
